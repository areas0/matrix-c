# Matrix-c
 A simple matrix toolkit in C
 
 ## Motivations
 During the conception of my AI for an OCR during S3, I had the bad surprise of discovering that most of the codes for AI are in python. Most of them use numpy to do matricial operations. I needed an equivalent but in C. Hence, I created this simple toolkit.
 
 ## Requirements
 Technically you only need the standard libraries to run this code.
